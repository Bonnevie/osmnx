Retrieve, construct, analyze, and visualize street networks from OpenStreetMap.

OSMnx is a Python package that lets you download spatial geometries and construct, project, visualize, 
and analyze street networks from OpenStreetMap's APIs. Users can download and construct walkable, drivable, or bikable 
urban networks with a single line of Python code, and then easily analyze and visualize them.
